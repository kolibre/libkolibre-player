What is Kolibre?
---------------------------------
Kolibre is a Finnish non-profit association whose purpose is to promote
information systems that aid people with reading disabilities. The software
which Kolibre develops is published under open source and made available to all
stakeholders at github.com/kolibre.

Kolibre is committed to broad cooperation between organizations, businesses and
individuals around the innovative development of custom information systems for
people with different needs.


History
---------------------------------
The software development started in 2002 by Norra Österbottens Svenska 
Synskadade rf (NÖSS), a Finnish non-profit contact, interest and service 
organization for visually impaired. NÖSS sought for a solution together with 
Jakobstads Tidning (today Österbottens Tidning)to modernize the daily talking 
newspaper which back then was distributed by tape.

Since then several projects, mainly funded by the Finnish Slot Machine 
Association, have been carried out in conjunction with other partners (i.e. 
Pratsam Ab) to improve and further develop the software for different needs:

  2003-2004:
  Den Digitala Taltidningen, (Eng. The digital talking newspaper)

  2005-2006:
  Digital Service för Synskadade, (Eng. Digital Services For Visually Impaired)

  2007-2008:
  Ett tillgängligt informationssamhälle, (Eng. An Accessible Information Society)

  2009-2012:
  Hjälpmedel för jämställdhet, (Eng. Aids For Equality)
